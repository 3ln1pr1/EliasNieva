{"name":"Bashblog","tagline":"A Bash script that handles blog posting","body":"bashblog\r\n========\r\n\r\nA single Bash script to create blogs. \r\n\r\nI created it because I wanted a very, very simple way to post entries to a blog by using a public folder on my server, without any special requirements and dependencies. Works on GNU/Linux, OSX and BSD.\r\n\r\nYou can see it live here: [read the initial blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204024/http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~carlesfe/blog/creating-a-simple-blog-system-with-a-500-line-bash-script.html). That page was 100% generated using bashblog, no additional tweaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- No installation required. Download `bb.sh` and start blogging.\r\n- Ultra simple usage: Just type a post with your favorite editor and the script does the rest. No templating.\r\n- All content is static. You only need shell access to a machine with a public web folder.\r\n  *Tip: advanced users could mount a remote public folder via `ftpfs` and run this script locally*\r\n- Allows drafts, includes a simple but clean stylesheet, generates the RSS file automatically.\r\n- Support for tags/categories\r\n- Support for Markdown, Disqus comments, Twitter, Feedburner, Google Analytics.\r\n- GNU/Linux, BSD and OSX compatible out of the box (no need for GNU `coreutils` on a Mac)\r\n- Everything stored in a single 700-line bash script, how cool is that?! ;) \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopy bb.sh into a public folder (for example, `$HOME/public_html/blog`) and run\r\n\r\n    ./bb.sh\r\n\r\nThis will show the available commands. If the file is not executable, you can either `chmod +x bb.sh`\r\nor run it with `bash bb.sh`\r\n\r\n**Before creating your first post, you may want to configure the blog settings (title, author, etc).\r\nRead the Configuration section below for more information**\r\n\r\nTo create your first post, just run:\r\n\r\n    ./bb.sh post\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, access the public URL for that folder  (e.g. `http://server.com/~username/blog`) \r\nand you should see the index file and a new page for that post!\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nConfiguration is not required for a test drive, but if you plan on running your blog with bashblog, you will\r\nwant to change the default titles, author names, etc, to match your own.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to configure the blog strings:\r\n\r\n- Edit `bb.sh` and modify the variables in the `global_variables()` function\r\n- Create a `.config` file with your configuration values (useful if you don't want to touch the script)\r\n\r\nThe software will load the values in the script first, then overwrite them with the values in the `.config` file.\r\nThis means that you don't need to define all variables in the config file, only those which you need to override\r\nfrom the defaults.\r\n\r\nThe format of the `.config` file is just one `variablename=\"value\"` per line, just like in the `global_variables()`\r\nfunction. **Please remember:** quote the values, do not declare a variable with the dollar sign, do not use \r\nspaces around the equal sign.\r\n\r\nbashblog uses the `$EDITOR` environment value to open the text editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed features\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n- A simple but nice and readable design, with nothing but the blog posts\r\n- **NEW on 2.0** Markdown support via a third-party library (e.g. \r\n  [Markdown.pl](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)). Use\r\n  it via `./bb.sh post -m`. The third party library must support an invokation\r\n  like `markdown_bin in.html > out.md` as the code calls it that way.\r\n- Post preview\r\n- Save posts as drafts and resume editing later\r\n- HTML page for each post, using its title as the URL\r\n- Configurable number of posts on the front page\r\n- Automatic generation of an RSS file, feedburner support\r\n- Additional page containing an index of all posts\r\n- Automatically generates pages for each tag\r\n- Rebuild all files while keeping the original data\r\n- Comments delegated to Twitter, with additional Disqus support\r\n- Google Analytics code support\r\n- Contains its own CSS so that everything is reasonably styled by default\r\n- Headers, footers, and in general everything that a well-structured html file needs\r\n- Support to add extra content on top of every page (e.g. banners, images, etc)\r\n- xhtml validation, CSS validation, RSS validation by the w3c\r\n- Automatic backup of the site every time you post (stored as `.backup.tar.gz`)\r\n\r\nRead the CHANGELOG section of the script header for more updates or [check out the news on my blog](http://cfenollosa.com/blog/tag_bashblog.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
